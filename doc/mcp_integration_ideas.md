# Design Document: Potential MCP Server Integrations for Smart Browser Assistant

## Goal

To explore potential enhancements for the Smart Browser Assistant Chrome extension by integrating external tools and resources via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Brainstormed MCP Server Ideas

Integrating MCP servers can significantly expand the capabilities of the extension beyond the core AI model's knowledge. Here are some potential integrations:

1.  **Web Search Server:**
    *   **Tool:** `search_web(query: string, num_results?: int)`
    *   **Benefit:** Provide real-time web context to the AI for current events or topics outside its training data. Essential for grounding responses in up-to-date information.

2.  **Content Summarization Server:**
    *   **Tool:** `summarize_url(url: string)` or `summarize_long_text(text: string, length?: string)`
    *   **Benefit:** Handle very long text selections or summarize entire web pages via context menu actions.

3.  **Specialized Translation Server:**
    *   **Tool:** `translate(text: string, target_language: string, source_language?: string)`
    *   **Benefit:** Offer potentially higher-quality or more cost-effective translations using dedicated services (e.g., Google Translate, DeepL) compared to relying solely on the general LLM.

4.  **Personal/Corporate Knowledge Base Server:**
    *   **Tool:** `search_docs(query: string, knowledge_base_id: string)`
    *   **Resource:** Access to specific document sets (e.g., Notion, internal wiki, Zotero).
    *   **Benefit:** Enable users to query their private knowledge stores using selected text as context.

5.  **Task Management Server:**
    *   **Tool:** `create_task(description: string, project?: string, due_date?: string)`
    *   **Benefit:** Allow users to create tasks in external systems (Todoist, Asana, etc.) directly from selected text on a webpage.

6.  **Calendar Integration Server:**
    *   **Tool:** `schedule_event(summary: string, start_time: string, end_time?: string, description?: string)`
    *   **Benefit:** Create calendar events from selected text describing meetings or appointments.

7.  **Code Execution & Analysis Server:**
    *   **Tool:** `run_code(code: string, language: string)` or `lint_code(code: string, language: string)`
    *   **Benefit:** Provide sandboxed execution or static analysis for selected code snippets.

8.  **Fact-Checking Server:**
    *   **Tool:** `verify_claim(claim: string)`
    *   **Benefit:** Integrate with fact-checking databases/APIs to assess the veracity of selected statements.

9.  **Data Extraction Server:**
    *   **Tool:** `extract_entities(text: string)` or `extract_structured_data(text: string, schema: object)`
    *   **Benefit:** Use specialized NLP models to pull out structured information (names, dates, contacts, etc.) from unstructured text.

## Specific Use Case: Legislative Bill Analysis

A particularly powerful application could involve analyzing legislative text (bills, laws). If the user selects text identified as part of a bill:

*   An MCP server could provide tools like:
    *   `fetch_bill_details(bill_identifier: string)`: Retrieve full text, status, sponsors, related documents from legislative databases (e.g., Congress.gov API, state legislature APIs).
    *   `analyze_bill_impact(bill_text: string, sector?: string)`: Use specialized legal analysis models or knowledge bases to summarize potential impacts, identify key clauses, or compare with existing laws.
    *   `find_related_legislation(bill_text: string)`: Search for similar or related bills.

*   This would require an MCP server connected to relevant legal databases and potentially specialized analytical tools. The extension could add context menu items like "Analyze Selected Bill Text" that trigger these MCP tools, feeding the results into the AI prompt for further discussion or summarization.

## Conclusion

MCP offers a structured way to add diverse, powerful capabilities to the Smart Browser Assistant. Prioritizing which integrations to build would depend on user needs and the availability/feasibility of creating or accessing the necessary backend tools and data sources via MCP servers.
